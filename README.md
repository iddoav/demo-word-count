# demo-word-count
A small excercise that demonstrates a simple map->associative-reduce scheme with Spark.
This program computes a words-count for a given file with Spark that is set to local mode.
The input file is given as the first argument of the main function. If no argument is given, it defaults to a file that collocates within the compiled project.
